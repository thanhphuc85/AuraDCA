## Tagline

An autonomous agent that lets Claude drive strategy while **code owns every number that touches money** — and pools many users' schedules into **one on-chain swap per token they chose, settled pro-rata**. Dollar-cost averaging into any token the network supports (you pick; cirBTC and EURC are wired on Arc Testnet today) is the reference implementation; the architecture underneath it is the contribution.

## The problem

"Agent-driven finance" is one of the hackathon's headline themes, but it hides a real tension: an LLM is great at contextual judgment, yet you can *never* let a language model be the final authority on how much money to move. Give it the keys and one hallucinated number drains the wallet. Take away all its agency and it's just a cron script with extra steps.

That tension gets sharper the moment the money isn't yours. An agent serving **many** users has to be fair as well as safe: each person's schedule honoured exactly, each person's funds ring-fenced from everyone else's, and every allocation reconstructable after the fact — while still executing efficiently on-chain rather than one transaction per user.

## What we built

An agent that resolves both halves of that, with **dollar-cost averaging as the concrete instance**:

**1. Claude decides the strategy — code owns the money.** Each run feeds Claude live balances, pacing, budget, and its own trade history, and asks — via a forced, schema-validated tool call — what to do and why. Claude reads its own history, paces spending, and declines to trade when it recognises the budget is spent. But its answer is only a *recommendation*: a pure, unit-tested `clampDecision()` re-derives the real cap from hard guardrails (max/day, minimum reserve, dust threshold, campaign budget) and is the sole authority on the number actually swapped. Every run records *which* constraint bound the result.

In **Smart mode** the agent doesn't just gate the buy — it **sizes** it, and this is where the LLM has real (bounded) authority over the amount. Each run a Claude sizing pass reads the market brief and the agent's own reflections and **proposes a multiplier**; code clamps that proposal into a hard envelope, then each user's sensitivity and max-multiplier bound it further, and the pooled total still passes through `clampDecision()` (max/day, reserve, remaining daily cap, campaign budget). If the sizing pass is unavailable, a deterministic dip + Fear & Greed formula takes over — so the agent's judgement moves the number, but only inside code-owned rails, and missing data can only be safe. Every smart run records its multiplier, **whether the agent or the formula chose it**, plus the Fear & Greed snapshot, to the committed [`history.json`](data/history.json) — auditable on-chain — and the dashboard shows a live preview before you sign plus a `⚡🧠 ×M` badge (⚡ marks an agent-chosen size).

> Our logo is that split, drawn: two orbits that never contain each other, meeting only where a decision is made.

**2. Many users, one swap, fair settlement.** Each wallet sets its own cadence, amount and caps. Every run the agent computes each user's due spend, executes the **sum as a single swap**, then distributes the received token **pro-rata by contribution** — scaling every share down together if a guardrail capped the total, and assigning the rounding remainder deterministically so the books always close. One transaction serves everyone; nobody subsidises anyone. ([`schedule.ts`](src/ledger/schedule.ts), unit-tested — and [proven on-chain](#does-it-run--the-honest-state): two wallets, one swap, split to the last unit.)

**3. Non-custodial by construction.** Users never hand over keys. Every state change — set schedule, run now, withdraw — is authorised by an **EIP-191 signature** the user makes in their own wallet and the server verifies before touching the ledger. The agent can execute the strategy; it can never invent a user's consent.

**4. It remembers.** After each run Claude writes a reflection to `data/reflections.json` and can recall past ones when deciding — which is how it recognised the cirBTC outage as *structural* and stopped burning fees on it.

**5. It anchors its own audit trail on-chain.** The pooled ledger (`data/ledger.json` — everyone's balances and allocations) is committed to git each run, but git alone is only as trustworthy as the repo. So after each run the agent hashes the committed ledger and records that hash in [`AuraAttestation.sol`](contracts/AuraAttestation.sol), a **purpose-built smart contract on Arc Testnet** ([`0x4948c6…F661`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0x4948c662630c7dE36BD59089085850c00996F661)) that only the agent's wallet may write to. Anyone can recompute `keccak256(data/ledger.json)` at a run's commit and check it against the on-chain `latestHash` — the off-chain books become tamper-evident on-chain. **The contract holds no funds and touches no balances**; a bug there can't move a token, which is why the whole path is best-effort and gated off by default. First attestation, live: [`0x2ddace…3e85`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x2ddace0e81c82fda8691f030094cd0a9ddac78d8365116832fe4551884f13e85) (verify it yourself, read-only, with `npm run verify-attest`).

The swap itself goes through Circle's official **Swap Kit** SDK — the only officially documented, reliably-available swap path on Arc Testnet (USDC / EURC / cirBTC). The wallet is a Circle **Developer-Controlled Wallet**, so there's no raw private key to leak.

It runs entirely on a **GitHub Actions cron** — no server to host. Each run commits its result back to `data/history.json` in the repo, producing a public, tamper-evident audit trail that grows over time.

### The dashboard — from bot to product

On top of the autonomous cron, we shipped a full **dashboard** (live at **[aura-dca.vercel.app](https://aura-dca.vercel.app)**) that turns the agent into something people can actually use:

![The Aura DCA dashboard](docs/dashboard.png)

- **Per-user, non-custodial DCA.** Anyone connects a wallet (EIP-6963 multi-wallet) or signs in with email, sets their **own** daily DCA rate, and the agent pools everyone's schedule into each run. Every state change (`set rate`, `run DCA now`, `withdraw`) is authorized by an **EIP-191 wallet signature** and verified in a Vercel serverless function — the user stays in control of their keys.
- **A conversational agent.** A Claude assistant (tool calling) answers "how much is in the treasury?", "explain the last trade", etc. from live on-chain data, and for sensitive actions it only **proposes** — the user confirms and signs in the UI before anything executes.
- **Vector memory + reflection.** After each run Claude writes a reflection to `data/reflections.json`; the dashboard surfaces this "agent memory" plus an **Agent intelligence** panel (risk / market regime / confidence / pattern alerts) derived from the run history.
- **Smart, dynamic sizing.** Opt into Smart mode and each scheduled buy is sized by live market conditions (drawdown + Fear & Greed), within a sensitivity and ceiling you set — with a live preview of this run's multiplier before you sign, and a `🧠 ×M` badge on every executed run.
- **Multi-agent decisions.** A Claude Haiku market-analyst produces a brief that the main decision agent factors into its allocation.
- **It tells you what it did.** The cron pushes a Telegram alert on every meaningful run — the amount, the token, the smart multiplier it used (and whether the agent or the formula chose it), what bound the size, and the tx link — so the agent reports to you without the dashboard being open.

## Does it run? — the honest state

You will open [`data/history.json`](data/history.json) and see many
`error_swap_failed` rows. Here is that, straight, before anything else in this
document tries to impress you. And here is the other half, equally straight: the
thesis of this project — *many users, one swap, settled pro-rata* — has now
executed on-chain, unsupervised, on the hourly cron.

**The flagship claim, proven live.** Run `2026-07-23T22:56Z`: two independent
wallets were due 1 USDC each, the agent pooled them into **one** swap and split
the proceeds by contribution —
[`0xd8a19f…1527`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0xd8a19fef1527ed91122ba29ec1ea9a845be1a7e3f3005450252f143956c07a19) (`2.00 USDC → 1.793953 EURC`).

| Wallet | Contributed | Received | Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xdd6045a6…` | 1.000000 USDC | 0.896977 EURC | 50.0% |
| `0xfc337ba1…` | 1.000000 USDC | 0.896976 EURC | 50.0% |

`0.896977 + 0.896976 = 1.793953` — the books close exactly, with the rounding
remainder assigned deterministically. It repeated the next run
(`2026-07-24T00:04Z`, [`0x0a7bd7…2d77`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x0a7bd7182d773a20b8665610f58523c2bfe3edf0a515f1d419b9fc5ec71519d7)).
Four successful swaps are recorded in total; every one of them is in
[`data/history.json`](data/history.json) with its tx hash.

**The audit anchor runs itself, too.** The cron has written **14 attestations (and counting)**
to [`AuraAttestation`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0x4948c662630c7dE36BD59089085850c00996F661)
without a human in the loop — each one the keccak256 of the ledger it just
committed.

**The cirBTC market does not.** `USDC → cirBTC` has returned *"No route available"*
on every attempt across 14 distinct calendar days (2026-07-08 → 2026-07-23). It's a liquidity outage on Arc
Testnet, not a bug in the agent — and `npm run check-routes` shows it's isolated
to cirBTC, which is the only volatile asset Arc carries (the chain is
stablecoin-native down to its USDC gas token).

**The agent handled it the way we'd want it to.** It recognised the failures as
*structural rather than transient*, recorded that reasoning in its own
[reflections](data/reflections.json), cut its probe frequency to stop burning
fees, and withheld spend to preserve capital across all all 16 days of the outage,
unsupervised. Knowing when *not* to act is the harder half of an autonomous money
agent, and this is the run of history where it was tested for real.

So we didn't paper over the outage by forcing the demo onto whatever still quotes.
Instead we made the **target token a per-user choice**: pick EURC and your buys
settle live today (proven on-chain, hourly); leave it on cirBTC and the agent
rides out the outage. EURC isn't a fig leaf over a dead pair — it's a real option,
and BTC-accumulation stays intact for anyone who wants it.
[What we measured](#what-we-measured-and-the-pivot-we-killed) is why we trust EURC
enough to offer it.

Both halves are live side by side right now — the dashboard's **DCA targets** panel
shows EURC wallets buying on a working route while the cirBTC wallet waits out a
dead one, from the same scheduler, in the same runs.

## How it works (flow)

```
GitHub Actions cron (hourly — each user's own cadence decides if this hour is theirs)
  → read Circle wallet USDC balance on Arc Testnet
  → computeScheduledSpends(): who is due now, how much each, capped by their limits
  → Claude decides / advises: { proceed, amountUsdc, reasoning }  (forced tool-use, zod-validated)
  → clampDecision(): hard guardrails enforce the real amount
  → group the due spends by each user's chosen token
  → Circle Swap Kit: ONE USDC → token swap per token group (or dry-run stub)
  → applyScheduledDistribution(): split each group pro-rata back to its users
  → append to data/history.json  →  commit back to repo
  → AuraAttestation.attest(keccak256(data/ledger.json)) — anchor the committed state on-chain
```

## Tech stack

- **TypeScript / Node.js**, run directly with `tsx` (no build step)
- **Anthropic Claude** (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) — the decision engine, via forced tool-use + zod validation
- **Circle Swap Kit** (`@circle-fin/swap-kit`) + **Developer-Controlled Wallets** (`@circle-fin/developer-controlled-wallets`) + Circle Wallets adapter
- **Arc Testnet** (Circle's stablecoin-native EVM L1; gas paid in USDC)
- **Solidity** — [`AuraAttestation.sol`](contracts/AuraAttestation.sol), a fund-less on-chain audit anchor deployed on Arc Testnet; the agent records `keccak256(data/ledger.json)` each run and anyone can reproduce it read-only with `npm run verify-attest`
- **GitHub Actions** for scheduling, secrets, and the commit-back audit trail — the same run also writes the on-chain attestation and pushes the Telegram alert
- **Vitest** — 65 unit tests on the safety-critical paths: `clampDecision()` guardrails (now the authority on the pooled swap total, too), the pooled pro-rata settlement (including per-token grouping), the smart-sizing envelope (formula + the clamp on the agent's own proposed multiplier, per-user sensitivity/cap bounds), the on-chain audit hash, and the outage-/campaign-day arithmetic the agent reasons from
- **Vercel** serverless functions (`api/`) for the dashboard's signed actions — set-rate, run-DCA, withdraw, chat, welcome-email
- **Single-file dashboard** (`docs/index.html`) — EIP-6963 wallet discovery, EIP-191 signing, EN/VI, light/dark

## What we measured (and the pivot we killed)

When the cirBTC route died, the tempting move was to pivot the thesis to something
that still worked. We nearly did — a USDC/EURC treasury FX rebalancer: same
scheduling engine, same guardrails, and EURC was the one pair still quoting.

Instead we measured first, because the cirBTC failure had already taught us the
lesson: **we had bet on something we never verified.** So before committing two
weeks, we sampled the EURC rate (`npm run sample-fx`, read-only).

The first half hour looked damning — nine identical readings, `1.1451554658`
every time. We very nearly wrote the pivot off as impossible. Then we kept the
sampler running:

```
03:04 → 03:48   1.1451554658   (held for 48 minutes)
03:53           1.1426120287   ← −0.2226%
03:58           1.1426120287
```

**The rate isn't pegged — the oracle just updates in coarse, roughly hourly
steps, and our first sample window had fallen entirely inside one of them.** A
half-hour of data would have had us confidently reporting a frozen market. The
finding wasn't "EURC is dead"; it was "we hadn't sampled long enough to see it
breathe."

That correction only happened because we kept measuring after we thought we had
the answer — and it's the part of this we'd defend hardest. The three probes
([`check-routes`](scripts/check-routes.mjs), [`prove-swap`](scripts/prove-swap.mjs),
[`sample-fx`](scripts/sample-fx.mjs)) all live in the repo and are reproducible;
`data/fx-samples.json` is the raw series behind the numbers above.

What the probes actually establish:

| Asset | Measured state |
|---|---|
| cirBTC | No liquidity — `No route available` on every attempt, 14 distinct days and counting |
| EURC | Live, and the rate does move — in ~hourly steps of ~0.22% |
| WBTC / WETH / USDT / DAI / … | Not wired to Arc Testnet at all |

So the pivot was viable after all — and the twist is we didn't have to choose.
Turning the **whole** product into a USDC/EURC FX rebalancer would have been a
different product than anyone asked for. But **offering EURC as one token among
several — while cirBTC stays the volatile BTC target — isn't that pivot.** It's
the multi-token generalisation we shipped: the target is now a per-user choice,
so EURC is available live to whoever wants it and BTC-accumulation is untouched.
The measurement is what let us offer EURC honestly, as a real option rather than
a demo cheat.

The honest position: the agent is correct, cirBTC's market is empty, and we have
the data to show which — including the data that proved our own first conclusion
wrong.

## What makes it stand out

- **The hard claim is proven, not asserted** — "many users, one swap, settled pro-rata" is the part most agent projects only describe. Ours did it on-chain, unsupervised, twice: two wallets pooled into one swap and split to the last unit.
- **Real, verifiable execution** — not a demo video. Real swaps, real per-user distributions, and green CI runs anyone can inspect.
- **Safety architecture** — the LLM-recommends / code-decides split is the whole point, and it's enforced by a tested pure function plus a two-switch live-trading gate (`DRY_RUN` + `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED`). The agent's own market read moves the buy size, but only inside bounds code owns.
- **It audits itself on-chain** — 14+ attestations written by the cron with no human involved; anyone can recompute the hash from the public repo.
- **Genuinely autonomous** — self-hosted on free CI, self-documenting via committed history, reasoning over its own past runs, and reporting to Telegram on every run.

## Challenges we ran into

- **The cirBTC pair went into a liquidity outage** — the headline one, covered in [Does it run?](#does-it-run--the-honest-state) and [What we measured](#what-we-measured-and-the-pivot-we-killed). Short version: we treated it as a measurement problem rather than an excuse, and shipped probes that make every claim here falsifiable.
- **Arc Testnet has no "real altcoin"** — community DEXs (ArcSwap/Presto/…) lacked publicly verified contract addresses, so we deliberately standardized on Circle's official Swap Kit (USDC↔EURC↔cirBTC) for a submission that actually runs.
- **Our own metric was lying to the agent.** `dayCount()` returned `history.length + 1` — the *run* count — but it reaches Claude in the decision context as `dayCount` and it reasons about pacing with it. At three runs a day the agent believed it was on "day 21" after a week, and its reflections overstated the outage's length by ~3x; once the cron went hourly it would have drifted 24x per real day. Found while fact-checking this document against `history.json` — the "20+ days" we had written came from the agent's own corrupted arithmetic. `dayCount` now counts distinct dates and is regression-tested. **An agent reasoning from a mislabeled number is confidently wrong, and nothing in the output looks broken** — which is the whole argument for keeping the money-authority in tested code rather than in the model.
- **A failed read is not a zero.** Arc's public RPC rate-limits bursts (`-32011`), and several dashboard readers coerced that error response to `0x0`. The treasury showed `cirBTC 0 · EURC 0` while the wallet held 22.68 EURC on-chain, and the deposits page rendered "No deposits yet" against a ledger holding 35 USDC across 4 deposits. Nothing looked broken — it looked *empty*, which is far more dangerous on a page whose entire claim is transparency. Readers now retry with backoff and **throw** instead of fabricating a zero; callers render "—" or omit the row. Same lesson as `dayCount`, one layer out: **a wrong number that looks plausible beats a loud error at hiding itself.**
- **Circle SDK packaging** — required Node ≥ 22 and had ESM named-export quirks that only surface on specific Node versions; pinned CI to Node 24 to match the verified runtime.
- **Token decimals are not interchangeable.** EURC withdrawals failed with "Invalid amounts in transfer request" because the client formatted every non-USDC token to 8 decimals; EURC carries 6, and Circle rejects the extra places. Fixed on both ends — the client maps decimals per token, and the API re-normalizes before calling Circle, so no stale client can reproduce it.
- **Empty-string config in CI** — unset GitHub Actions variables arrive as `""`, which zod's `.default()` doesn't fill; fixed with an explicit empty-to-undefined preprocess.

## What's next

- **Per-user token choice already ships** — each wallet picks its target (cirBTC or EURC today), and the run settles one pooled swap per token. The next step is a Claude-*decided* split across multiple **volatile** assets, which needs Arc to wire more than one; it unlocks the day cirBTC's market returns or Arc lists others.
- A live P&L / cost-basis panel — the per-token fill chart already plots the real EURC rate the agent paid on each run; cost-basis is the next layer, and cirBTC joins automatically the day its route returns
- Verified sender domain for the welcome email so it reaches any user, not just the operator's inbox
- Mainnet-readiness review when Arc mainnet ships

> Since the first submission we grew this from a headless cron bot into a usable product — and then proved the part that mattered. The pooled multi-user swap stopped being an architecture diagram and became two on-chain transactions splitting to the last unit; the agent gained bounded authority over its own buy size; and it now anchors its ledger on-chain and reports to Telegram every run, with nobody watching. Same code-owns-the-money guardrail throughout.

## Brand & trademark

**Aura DCA is an independent project built on Arc Network — not affiliated with, endorsed by, or a product of Circle.**

Checked against the [Arc brand guidelines and partner toolkit](https://www.arc.io/brand-guidelines-and-partner-toolkit):
the product name and logo are **Aura's own** ("Arc" appears in neither); Arc is referenced
only in the approved factual sense (*built on Arc Network*, *on Arc Testnet*), never as
endorsement; "Arc Network" is used on first mention; and we use **no** Arc or Circle brand
assets at all, which is the simplest way to honour the rules on modifying or over-weighting
their mark. The [README](README.md#brand--trademark) has the point-by-point mapping.

## Safety note

Testnet only. Funds are valueless faucet tokens. Guardrails are enforced in code, not by the model; live trading requires two explicit switches to be enabled.
